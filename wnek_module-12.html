                        I have worked as a customer service representative for Anthem, Inc. In that role, I 
                        demonstrated proficiency in telephone customer service. I also utilized problem-solving

                        I've worked several different roles at Chipotle, from crew member to shift manager.

                        Chipotle, I've had the opportunity to think quickly on my feet and devise a plan of action while
                        delegating tasks to crew members and maintaining food safety throughout the store.
